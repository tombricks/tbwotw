Salah Jadid (1926-1993)
 - Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army (1963-1966)
 - Assistant Regional Secretary of the Syrian Ba'ath (1965-1970)
Jadid moved from the SSNP to the Ba'ath to the Arab Nationalist Movement. By 1959, as a Ba'athist, he supported Nasser and the UAR and co-founded the Military Committee. Jadid and the Military Committee opposed the dissolution of the UAR and were persecuted post-1961 coup. Nevertheless, he was Chief of Staff of the Syrian Army 1963 to 1966 and Assistant Regional Secretary of the Syrian Ba'ath 1965-1970. Jadid sent help to Palestinians during Black October and garnered the support of the Soviets and Syrian Communist Party but was purged by Assad during the Corrective Movement.

Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000)
 - Minister of Defence (1966-1972)
 - Regional Secretary of the Syrian Ba'ath (1970-2000)
 - Prime Minister of Syria (1970-1971)
 - Secretary General of the Arab Ba'ath (1971-2000)
 - President of Syria (1971-2000)
Assad was an Alawite and approached pro-Alawite parties like the Communists, SSNP and Ba'ath. He joined the Ba'ath in 1946 and helped organising amongst students and Alawite poor which saw him opposed by the Muslim Brotherhood. Assad was sent to both Nasser's Egypt and the Soviet Union and would rise through military ranks under the UAR. Like other Ba'athists he was removed from the military following the 1961 coup. As the dominant member of the Military Committee, he helped hastily orchestrate the 1963 Syrian coup after the Iraqi one. He indoctrinated the military into Ba'athism and led the air force. He positioned himself as a non-communist leftist in the Regional Command. A spat grew of him and Jadid against Aflaq and Umran. He allied the regionalists whom Aflaq deemed traitors. After the 1966 coup which saw the Military Committee overthrow the National Command and establish neo-Ba'athism, he was made Minister of Defence. Jadid was the undisputed leader but Assad gained de facto control over the military and launched the largest purge to date alongside Jadid after the failed late 1966 coup. However, this resulted in an absolute loss during the Six-Day War and the civilian and military leadership began quarreling. Assad was almost voted out of the Regional Command. Assad criticised Jadid for his support of people's war, class struggle, oversupport of Palestinian guerrilas, breaking of reactionary diplomatic relations. He also criticised Jadid's centralisation and party elitism. Assad wanted to reconcile with the Iraqi Ba'ath after they came to power. Assad launched a near-coup in 1969 resulting in Jadid moderating. Nasser, Boumediene and Iraq all tried to reconcile them. Following the failure of Syrian intervention in Black September, he began preparing for a coup. When Assad was attacked at the 1970 congress, he had leading Jadidists arrested. As leader, he eased repression and listened to voices. He had support from citizens and took an overall moderate and pragmatic approach. He invited former Aflaqists from the 1963-1966 power struggle back to the party but prosecuted Aflaq, Amin al-Hafiz and their followers. This was the Corrective Movement and a return to the true "nationalist socialist line". He institutionalised and made himself into a more-powerful president. The Ba'ath Regional Congress had de facto authority and the National Congress was compared to the Comintern, and was a de facto foreign policy and ideology focused session. He was sectarian and increased Alawite power. Economic liberalisation led to a new state bureaucratic class gaining. The Muslim Brotherhood became the largest anti-Ba'athist force and launched an uprising in the mid-to-late 1970s. The crisis-surrounded 1980 congress saw a new technocratic government under Abdul Rauf al-Kasm but the Sunni middle class, radical left and anti-military Ba'athists collaborated with the Islamists. This culminated in the 1982 Hama massacre and the country became totalitarian. Hafez had a heart attack in 1983 and Rifaat announced his candidacy for president. He had little support from top officials, was corrupt and his Defense Companies were viewed with suspicion. There was a poster war. Rifaat's proteges were removed and a clash nearly began between his Defence Companies and the Republican Guard. He surrendered his comamndership of the companies to become vice president but a few weeks later, he ordered Defense Company loyalists to seal and take Damascus. Ali Haydar, Special Forces commander, sided with president and Rifaat was put in exile for a year. Foreign policy-wise, he planned on attack on Israel. He allowed Soviets a stable presence in the Middle East and met with Brezhnev multiple times. He believed if the UAR never collapsed, Palestine would be liberated. The 1971 agreement with Anwar Sadat's Egypt and the Federation of Arab Republics project with Egypt, Libya and briefly Sudan saw the beginning of war planning. However, Sadat decieved Syria and didn't launch a full offensive and was skeptical of the Ba'athists. Assad intervened in the Lebanese civil war in 1976 with the PLA but he opposed radical leftist Lebanese and threatened the PLO. He began a full intervention to defeat Palestinian forces with As-Sa'iqa (Lebanese Ba'ath) on Syria's side.

However, he held no role in the Regional Command or Syrian government and only had command over Damascus' radio station due to his percieved recklessness. He made connections with supporters of Hafiz and Bitar but was arrested and there was a crackdown on Druze officers and the largest purge in Syrian history to that point. He fled to Jordan and opposed Alawite sectarianism. He returned to Syria to fight Israel in the Six-Day War as he believed he wouldn't be executed. He was executed.

He agreed with Miceh Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar to merge into the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. His relationship with Aflaq ended in 1962 as he was opposed to gaining power through military coups. He resigned as vice president in 1959 after Nasser attacked the Ba'ath and repressed its members.

After the Iraqi Ba'ath were ousted from power in 1963, he and his supporters were expelled from the party. Nevertheless, he served as Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1978 to 1981.
