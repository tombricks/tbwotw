 EQG_there_is_no_other_god: "There is no other God than Macías"
 EQG_there_is_no_other_god_desc: "Liberty and stability is far from common in this world and there is nowhere else this rings quite as true as in Equatorial Guinea. The \"Unique Miracle\" Macías Nguema has a near-undisputed total command of the country and his paranoia and absurdity are taking their toll on the nation. From rival clan members to his own family and ministers, no one is safe from his erratic and fatal persecutions. He went from having himself thanked before Catholic Mass to outlawing Christianity, because \"there is no other God than Macías.\" The mere word \"intellectual\" is banned and those with glasses are killed. Where his enemies aren't summarily executed, they are given a show trial and get sent to his infamous prison camps where torture is rife and it is no wonder that almost half the country have fled his tyranny even despite him having boats destroyed to prevent people from sailing off."
 EQG_there_is_no_other_god_tt: "§RWhile this spirit is active, you will recieve random events spawned by Nguema's erraticity.§!"
